## Education :mortar_board:
Previously, I attended Georgia State University where I majored in Biology with a concentration in Biochemistry and minor in Psychology. I absolutely loved the material (especially my Genetics class where the class focused on genetics in relation to cancer) however, I ran out of Financial Aid and decided being a Pharmacist was no longer something I wanted to pursue. After I discovered my enjoyment of Computer Science, I changed my major and enrolled in my school's Associates Degree program in Computer Science using my employer tuition benefits. I work full time, so I take classes when they fit my schedule.
