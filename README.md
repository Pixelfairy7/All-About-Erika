# About Me :unicorn:
Hi! My name is Erika and I am currently transitioning into tech, mainly focusing on Front End Web Development. My current industry is Automotive Insurance and my previous background was in Customer Service. I love learning new things, and I am looking forward to seeing where my journey will take me. I am currently looking for a role in an organization where I can grow my skills while still providing value to my team, and one day I hope to teach other's looking to change careers.

## Education :mortar_board:
Previously, I attended Georgia State University where I majored in Biology with a concentration in Biochemistry and minor in Psychology. I absolutely loved the material (especially my Genetics class where the class focused on genetics in relation to cancer) however, I ran out of Financial Aid and decided being a Pharmacist was no longer something I wanted to pursue. After I discovered my enjoyment of Computer Science, I changed my major and enrolled in my school's Associates Degree program in Computer Science using my employer tuition benefits. I work full time, so I take classes when they fit my schedule.  

## Interests/Hobbies :information_desk_person:
My main interests are travelling, cooking and eating! In my spare time I enjoy making handcrafted body products such as cold processed soaps, emulsified body scrubs and whimsical children's glycerin soaps.
